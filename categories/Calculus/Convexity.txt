What Is Convexity?
Convexity is a measure 
of the curvature, or the degree of the curve, in the relationship 
between bond prices and bond yields. Convexity demonstrates 
how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. 
Portfolio managers will use convexity as a risk-management tool, 
to measure and manage the portfolio's exposure to interest rate 
risk.
