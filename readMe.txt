Every note can be associated with one of five particular "states". Those are the symbols visible on the main screen of our app. By default, they mean going from the top:
 - notes you don't know, some new notes, or very hard stuff
 - neutral, you studied it only for a bit
 - things you are perfectly familiar with
 - favourites
The last one is default: "none". Of course, you can use then with any meaning you want. By clicking on one of those symbols notes are going to be filtered by a particular state. 

What is more, you can search notes by names - textfield top-left.

Last but not least, you can open the file in two ways. 

 - By an external default app (top-left)
 - Or just in the app.

 After opening file in the app, you are able to do some actions with it i.e.:
 - rename
 - edit
 - save
 - change state
 - full screen (top-right)
 - Use spelling checker (top-right)
